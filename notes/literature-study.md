Emotion recognition technologies:
- Facial expressions:
- Body gestures/postures
- Audio/voice/speech
- Physiological signals: more objective/reliable than others.
- Textual data

## Speech emotion recognition
SER has two group of features:
- Global features: long-term which express gross stats such as max, min, mean, std.
- Local features: short-term which approximate stationary and depict temporal dynamics states.

To examine the local and overall characteristics of the SER system, 4 categories are used: spectral features, prosodic characteristics, voice quality features, and Teager energy Operator (TEO) based features. Spectral and prosodic aspects are more commonly used in SERs, while TEO traits are designed to recognize wrath and stress.

There are two approaches to model a SER:
- Traditional way (using GMM, SVM, HMMs): require heavy-workload on feature engineering and domain expertise to identify the most relevant features.
- Deep learning-based:
