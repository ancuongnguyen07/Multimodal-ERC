The report should be no more than **10** pages.

## Report structure
- **Title page**: the course code and course name, student name(s) and ID(s), date, the topic of your project.
- **Introduction**: Describe the research problem: You can think of it through answering questions like why is it a relevant or interesting problem? How can one approach it, in general? How are you approaching it in this work?
- **Literature study**: Your previously written literature study. Modify it to fit into the report by adding and removing texts.
- **Methods**: Describe the methods that you use in the work.
- **Experiments**: What is the experimental setup? Give sufficient details on how the experiments were carried out, so that another person familiar with this course but not with this topic might replicate your experiments.
- **Results**: Describe the results of your experiments. You may want to use tables to summarize results, or to show typical samples or particularly interesting cases.
- **Conclusions / Discussion**: Based on your results, what conclusions can you draw regarding the question you set out to study?
- **Division of labor**: In a group work, describe who did what.
- **Acknowledgments**: Did you get help? Anyone you wish to particularly thank?
- **References**: The bibliography that you utilized, and that you refer to in the text
- **Appendix**: Your own program code, possible excerpts of data etc.

In each section you should make appropriate references to literature: books, articles and software packages. Also, WWW references are allowed, in which case you should mention the date when the URL was accessed.

Describe the data set in the report, and append samples of it to the Appendix. The data set might be described either in a section of its own, or in Introduction or combined with the Experiments section (with title Data set and Experiments).
