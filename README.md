### How to build the LaTeX report
Make sure that you have TeX packages installed in your machine.
Then run
```sh
cd report # change directory to `report`
make
```

The `report.pdf` should be in `report/build/final/report.pdf`.
In case you could not build the PDF file in your machine,
the up-to-date PDF report files are at `report/pdf`
